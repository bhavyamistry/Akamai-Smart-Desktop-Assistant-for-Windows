## Project Overview

Akamai is a voice-based personal assistant designed to streamline tasks within an enterprise environment. It serves as a versatile tool for various functions including search, reminders, and note-taking, all through voice commands. With Akamai, users can effortlessly interact with their system by simply speaking commands.

## Problem Statement

In response to the lack of a robust voice assistant for `Windows 7`, Akamaii was specifically developed to support this operating system version. At its creation, `Cortana`, `Microsoft's` voice assistant, did not offer compatibility with `Windows 7`, leaving users without a convenient voice-based solution. Akamai fills this gap by offering voice-controlled automation tailored specifically for Windows 7 users, enhancing accessibility and productivity on the platform. While originally targeting Windows 7, Akamaii has since been expanded to support Windows 8 and 10, catering to a broader user base with its voice-driven functionality.

## Features

- **Background Operation:** Once launched, Akamaii runs in the background, ensuring continuous availability without the need for manual startup.
- **Voice Commands:** Users can perform various functions by issuing voice commands, eliminating the need for manual keyboard input and enhancing ease of use.
- **Familiar Interface:** Akamaii's interface provides a familiar look and feel, reminiscent of popular smart assistants like Google Assistant, ensuring a comfortable user experience.
- **Basic Computer Functions:** Users can execute basic computer functions such as shutdown, restart, disk check, and error diagnosis through simple voice commands.
- **File Management:** Akamaii facilitates file management tasks such as creation, searching, and deletion, enabling users to manipulate files with ease.
- **Application Control:** Users can instruct Akamaii to open desktop applications installed on their machine, simplifying application access.
- **Web Search and Browsing:** In addition to offline features, Akamaii supports web search and browsing commands, allowing users to search the web or open specific websites effortlessly.
- **Natural Language Interaction:** Users can naturally converse with Akamaii, asking questions or issuing commands as they would with a personal assistant.
- **Mathematical Operations:** Akamaii functions as a calculator, enabling users to perform basic mathematical operations through voice commands.
- **Speech-to-Text Notes:** Akamaii offers a speech-to-text feature, allowing users to create notes or documents by dictating them verbally, saving time and effort.
- **Mute Functionality:** Users have the option to mute Akamaii's listening capability while speaking, providing privacy and control over interactions.
